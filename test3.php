      —In the process of Online IEEE paper generation System, a large number of technical IEEE papers are
written and used. The Online IEEE paper generation system is the final result of the survey and is a crucial
basis for related IEEE paper and construction. It has become an urgent demand to effectively manage and
automatically prepare research paper through automatic Online IEEE paper generation systems. The
realization of these systems needs to first develop the key technology of automatic generation of IEEE papers,
such as template customization, template storage, data filling, and programmatic generation—In the process of Online IEEE paper generation System, a large number of technical IEEE papers are
